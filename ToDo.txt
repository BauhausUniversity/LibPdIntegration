LibPdIntegration ToDo
---------------------

v2.1.0 ToDo:
---------------
- See if it's possible to build libpd using Unity's own toolchain (IL2CPP).

- Support use of externals on Windows. This apparently requires us to rename
  libpd.dll to pd.dll, but that alone does not seem to allow externals to
  load. I don't know what the actual problem is :(
- Create singleton LibPdManager class to handle all of the global operations
  libpd requires us to work with.
- printHook deletion in OnApplicationQuit()?
- Linux build of libpd.
- Build in my own spatialisation code?
- Should I separate the LibPD stuff out from the MonoBehaviour?
    - I do like the single-file approach for a library.
- More robust Print implementation (let users redirect to their own classes).
- Add a public array of symbols to bind to when LibPdInstance is constructed,
  so clients don't need to call Bind()/UnBind() themselves?
