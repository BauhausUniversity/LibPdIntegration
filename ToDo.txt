LibPdIntegration ToDo
---------------------
- Fix libpd -> Unity communication.
    - Implement queued version of libpd.
    - Update wiki once it's all working.

- printHook deletion in OnApplicationQuit()?
- Linux build of libpd.
- Build in my own spatialisation code?
- Should I separate the LibPD stuff out from the MonoBehaviour?
    - I do like the single-file approach for a library.
- More robust Print implementation (let users redirect to their own classes).
- Use queued version instead?
- Add a public array of symbols to bind to when LibPdInstance is constructed,
  so clients don't need to call Bind()/UnBind() themselves?
