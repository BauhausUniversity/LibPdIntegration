LibPdIntegration ToDo
---------------------
- v2.0.1 release todo:
    - Test builds work with 32bit Windows in 2018.1.
    - Test builds work with 64bit Windows in 2019.1.
    - Test builds work with 32bit Windows in 2019.1.
    - Update README.md to mention it's been tested with 2019.1.
    - Do v2.0.1 release of LibPdIntegrationExamples.

- printHook deletion in OnApplicationQuit()?
- Linux build of libpd.
- Build in my own spatialisation code?
- Should I separate the LibPD stuff out from the MonoBehaviour?
    - I do like the single-file approach for a library.
- More robust Print implementation (let users redirect to their own classes).
- Use queued version instead?
- Add a public array of symbols to bind to when LibPdInstance is constructed,
  so clients don't need to call Bind()/UnBind() themselves?
