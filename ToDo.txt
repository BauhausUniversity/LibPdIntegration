LibPdIntegration ToDo
---------------------
- printHook deletion in OnApplicationQuit()?
- Linux build of libpd.
- Build in my own spatialisation code?
- Should I separate the LibPD stuff out from the MonoBehaviour?
    - I do like the single-file approach for a library.
- More robust Print implementation (let users redirect to their own classes).
- Use queued version instead?
