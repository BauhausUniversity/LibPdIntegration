LibPdIntegration ToDo
---------------------

v2.0.3 ToDo:
---------------
- Update README.md.
- Check wiki is still accurate.
- Update info about spatialisation.
- Re-take screenshots.
- Verify linux libraries are working.
- See if it's possible to build libpd using Unity's own toolchain (IL2CPP).
- Verify it works in 2018.4 & 2019.4.
- Use pd.dll instead of libpd.dll.
	- Does this fix externals without me needing to re-build the lib?

- Create singleton LibPdManager class to handle all of the global operations
  libpd requires us to work with.
- printHook deletion in OnApplicationQuit()?
- Linux build of libpd.
- Build in my own spatialisation code?
- Should I separate the LibPD stuff out from the MonoBehaviour?
    - I do like the single-file approach for a library.
- More robust Print implementation (let users redirect to their own classes).
- Add a public array of symbols to bind to when LibPdInstance is constructed,
  so clients don't need to call Bind()/UnBind() themselves?
